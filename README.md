# Ascella
Quantum application notebooks for our cloud-accessible platform Ascella. The notebooks reproduce all the results presented in our white-paper for Ascella entitlde "A general-purpose single-photon-based quantum computing platform". It features: 
- a *variational quantum eigensolver algorithm*. 
- a *classification task* using a photon-native variationnal algorithm. 
- the code to reproduce the *benchmarking* of quantum gates.
- the generation of *heralded GHZ$_3$ states*.  
- a *Boson Sampling* example.
